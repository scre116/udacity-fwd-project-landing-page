# Landing Page Project

## Description

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display static content with added interactive behavior.

Added functionality:

- Dynamically build navigation menu
- Scroll to section on click of navigation item
- Highlight current section
- Highlight current navigation item

The index.html contains four static sections. In the real world the HTML would be generated
by the backend with content already inserted, or the content would be added by JavaScript from a Web API call.
Working with the Web APIs is the topic of the next course section / next project.
